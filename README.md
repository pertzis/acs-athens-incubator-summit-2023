# acs-athens-incubator-summit-2023
The **ACS Athens Incubator Innovation Summit**  is an event where student representatives of other schools come together to share their passion expressed through engaging workshop presentations to existing ACS Athens students.

As an ACS Athens student representative, I had the opportunity to 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 an interactive workshop on the **importance of cybersecurity** in today’s digital world.

To make the session engaging for a younger audience, I developed:
- ▶️ A **slideshow presentation** introducing key cybersecurity concepts and their impact in today's digital world.
- 💻 A **custom built command-and-control (C2) server and client** that allowed students to experience the dynamics between an attacker and a victim in a controlled, educational environment.

During the activity, one of the students pretended to be the victim, needing to complete computer-based tasks. The other student used the C2 client, acting as the attacker and took part in disrupting the progress of the victim. The exercise gave students hands-on insight into how cyberattacks work, and why cybersecurity awareness is crucial.
